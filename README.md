# Chatbot
This a Chatbot developed in Python, which works step-by-step as it learns from the user.
This Chatbot is designed initially in such a way that it uses the responses provided by the user.
For example,
In it's initial if the bot is greeted with a "Hello" response by the user the bot would not be able to reply back the user with a perfect answer, instead it would reply back the user asking would be the probable
answer to it. As the user answers the reply to the question, the bot immediately records such a response and stores it in its .json file (knowledge_base.json as referred in the file). The next time the user asks
the bot the same question, the bot can easily answer back with a perfect reply to the user.
